# "Let's measure our culture health!"

^Suggested to mgmt that we do Westrum surveys', much like "Lets do coffee!" -- assuming a) universal knowledge and b) universal agreement. 

^There comes a time when you work with smart, closely aligned colleagues when you're surprised when they don't  know a thing that you think is obvious and of clear value. And knowing that they're smart and competent, maybe you should question your assumptions and value proposition.

^So let's tackle some of the assumptions that I was making, that is:

---

# Does culture matter?

# Can you measure it?

# Can you change it?

---

# Trust

* Psychological Safety
* Team Empowerment
* Regulatory Setting
