# üå±Culture is not Squushyüå±
## Peter Burkholder
## DevOpsDC, February 2019


^A few weeks ago at work there was some discussion whether our group had the same values and drive as we did a few year ago, and I jumped in with what I thought was an obvious answer, namely: 

---

# "Let's measure our Westrum typology!"

^Suggested to mgmt that we do Westrum surveys', much like "Lets do coffee!" -- assuming a) universal knowledge and b) universal agreement. 

^There comes a time when you work with smart, closely aligned colleagues when you're surprised when they don't  know a thing that you think is obvious and of clear value. And knowing that they're smart and competent, maybe you should question your assumptions and value proposition.

^So let's tackle some of the assumptions that I was making, starting with some DevOps history. Back in 2009, Patrick Debois organized the first Agile Infrastructure conference, and to harness Twitter's 140-character limit, he dubbed it DevOps Days, a term that we carry with us still. Since there's no DevOps Manifesto, DevOps has been defined variously be diff practitioners, but an early outline came from John Willis and Damon Edwards, namely:

---

# CA(L)MS

* Culture
* Automation
* (Lean -- added later)
* Metrics 
* Sharing

^ and at that time John said nothing more about it other than: "People and process first.  If you don‚Äôt have culture, all automation attempts will be fruitless." Which may be true but isn't particularly helpful.


^ And for the next few years, I think culture in DevOps was squushy by people who applied a "you know it when you see it" mentality, but measuring it came more into focus as some rigor started to be applied to our DevOps attributes

## Measuring Culture  (2012)

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you EXACTLY what devops means. Devops means giving a shit about your job enough to not pass the buck. Devops means giving a shit about your job enough to want to learn all the parts and not just your little world. Developers need to understand infrastructure. Operations people need to understand code. People need to fucking work with each other and not just occupy space next to each other.‚Äù John Vincent | @lusis | http://bit.ly/12DkRhf

^ They identified that they need to measure culture, to identify High Mgmt Trust vs Low Mgmt Trust styles, and that they needed metrics that enable regression, using a "Likert-type scale"

until Nicole Forsgren starting working with Puppet on the State of DevOps Survey in 2013, and published their first report in 2014.
