# ðŸŒ±Culture is not SquushyðŸŒ±
## Peter Burkholder
## DevOpsDC, February 2019


^A few weeks ago at work there was some discussion whether our group had the same values and drive as we did a few year ago, and I jumped in with what I thought was an obvious answer, namely: 

---

# "Let's measure our Westrum typology!"

^Suggested to mgmt that we do Westrum surveys', much like "Lets do coffee!" -- assuming a) universal knowledge and b) universal agreement. 

^There comes a time when you work with smart, closely aligned colleagues when you're surprised when they don't  know a thing that you think is obvious and of clear value. And knowing that they're smart and competent, maybe you should question your assumptions and value proposition.

^So let's tackle some of the assumptions that I was making, starting with some DevOps history. Back in 2009, Patrick Debois organized the first Agile Infrastructure conference, and to harness Twitter's 140-character limit, he dubbed it DevOps Days, a term that we carry with us still. Since there's no DevOps Manifesto, DevOps has been defined variously be diff practitioners, but an early outline came from John Willis and Damon Edwards, namely:

---

# CA(L)MS

* Culture
* Automation
* (Lean -- added later)
* Metrics 
* Sharing

^ 


# Does culture matter?

# Can you measure it?

# Can you change it?

---

---

# Trust

* Psychological Safety
* Team Empowerment
* Regulatory Setting
