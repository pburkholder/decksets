# TLS is 2 things:

1. - üîê - Encrypted transport
2. - ‚úÖ - Service entity validation

---

# üîê - Encrypted transport

The encryption is agreed upon between the client and services. Most clients don't agree to use weak encryption. All the services we run use strong well-supported encryption. It's not in the picture when we talk about Let's Encrypt vs., say, DigiCert

---

# ‚úÖ - Service entity validation

How do you know, when browsing to `example.gov` that the page is actually coming from `example.gov`, and not `evil.ru`?

From the server certificate with a signature from a Certificate Authority (CA)

---

# The conversation

- When the client connects with the server, it says "ClientHello" - I accept these ciphers, lets' talk.
- The server replies, "Cool, here's my Server Certificate proving I'm example.gov"

The client now validates the server's certificate

---

# The validation

The server certification is signed by a "Certificate Authority"

The client has a list, e.g. Firefox: about:preferences#privacy

It checks if the Server Certificate has a valid signature that can be traced back to the Certificate Authority.

---

# Key point as server operator:

**From a server operator's perspective, any CA is identical to any others: the clients will treat them the same. Use the cheapest and easiest one.**

I have felt this way since 2002, and nothing since then has change my perpspective. (https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threats/paper/480)

---

# Key point as a desktop system manager:

From a client (desktop) operator's prespective, I may want to restrict CAs, as .mil does.

Commercial CAs have had their own issues:

Who is Let's Encrypt?

- Funding
- Board of Directors
- Why they exist

--- 

Growth of TLS is good, EVs are now deprecated.

---

All the downsides of Let's Encrypt are features, not bugs 

---

What happened with this issue and why the revocations?

Remember LE has now issued 1Bn certs...

---

The protection is DNS is not relevant. Even if you don't use LE, if you don't control your DNS, then someone else could.

DNSSEC is a different issue.
